#### Considering the ambitious goals of Norm, describe a future scenario where AI in law has significantly changed the world, and how you would contribute to realizing this scenario.

<p> Norm AI is a revolution in the making. Applying AI to make sense of complex legal and regulatory documents is going to help lawyers and compliance analysts 10x their work. I believe in the future Norm AI will become an indispensable tool, and it can also be used by regular individuals in order to understand legal documents in their daily lives and allow them to make more intelligent decisions without getting lost in the complex legal language. What excites me the most about Norm AI is the scale of the problem and ever expanding Norm AI that learns and adapts with the most current set of laws, this unlocks a powerful tool for people who donâ€™t keep up with the latest laws.


I believe I can bring my technical skills and product focused mindset to Norm AI to explore new product market ideas. I can utilize my experience as Software Engineer At Cigna where I worked with non-technical business analysts to sort through complex insurance documents and build them a web application that helped them better negotiate insurance prices, this experience showed me to ground the product around the users. I believe a product focused engineering is exactly what Norm AI needs at this stage in order to scale up so that Norm AI becomes the standard in every legal office and regulatory office.</p>
